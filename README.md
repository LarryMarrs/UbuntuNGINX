# UbuntuNGINX

# Install Web server NGinx on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
# No error checking use  '-x'  in first line of bash script to debug 
# Must be run with a user ID that requires no passwd for sudo 
# All commands have standard output so a tool that calls the script 
# should have standard logging for each executing step.
